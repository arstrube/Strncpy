TESTS TO COMPARE BEHAVIOR OF STRNCPY VS. STRNCPY_S

These tests were written to determine whether it would be
preferable to use strncpy_s() in the CppUTest project,
even though the destination size parameter would be ignored,
or to continue using strncpy().

Also, for non-Microsoft targets, whether there is a
suitable implementation of strncpy_s() for GNU-based
systems.

Because of this, macros are employed, and each test
tests all implementations, so it is easy to see where
they differ.
